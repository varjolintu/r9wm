# r9wm
A simple window manager written in Rust

Only for testing purposes. It's not perfect (and probably will not ever be).

Base code copied from [rust-tinywm](https://github.com/acmiyaguchi/rust-tinywm).
Further development inspired by [uwurawrxdwm](https://github.com/vardy/uwurawrxdwm).

No configuration file, but the following commands work:

- Drag windows with `Alt + left mouse button`
- Resize windows with `Alt + right mouse button`
- Start `urxvt` with `Alt+Return`
- Start `dmenu` with `Alt+d`
- Start `rofi` with `Alt+Space`
- Exit r9wm with `Alt+BackSpace`
